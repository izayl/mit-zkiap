## ZKP for 3-coloring

Visit http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/graph/svg.html and play around with the interactive demo. This is a programmatic version of the 3-coloring example we went over in class.

*Exercise 1*: Currently, you can only select adjacent pairs of nodes to check. Would the proof still be zero knowledge if you could pick arbitrary pairs of nodes to check?

*Exercise 2*: The equation currently being used for confidence is 1-(1/E)^n, where E is the number of edges in the graph, and n is the number of trials run. Is this the correct equation? Why is there no prior?
