## Num2Bits

Parameters: nBits
Input signal(s): in
Output signal(s): b[nBits]
The output signals should be an array of bits of length nBits equivalent to the binary representation of in. b[0] is the least significant bit.

## IsZero

Parameters: none
Input signal(s): in
Output signal(s): out
Specification: If in is zero, out should be 1. If in is nonzero, out should be 0. This one is a little tricky!

## IsEqual

Parameters: none
Input signal(s): in[2]
Output signal(s): out
Specification: If in[0] is equal to in[1], out should be 1. Otherwise, out should be 0.

## Selector

Parameters: nChoices
Input signal(s): in[nChoices], index
Output: out
Specification: The output out should be equal to in[index]. If index is out of bounds (not in [0, nChoices)), out should be 0.

## IsNegative

NOTE: Signals are residues modulo p (the Babyjubjub prime), and there is no natural notion of “negative” numbers mod p. However, it is pretty clear that that modular arithmetic works analogously to integer arithmetic when we treat p-1 as -1. So we define a convention: “Negative” is by convention considered to be any residue in (p/2, p-1], and nonnegative is anything in [0, p/2)

Parameters: none
Input signal(s): in
Output signal(s): out
Specification: If in is negative according to our convention, out should be 1. Otherwise, out should be 0. You are free to use the CompConstant circuit, which takes a constant parameter ct, outputs 1 if in (a binary array) is strictly greater than ct when interpreted as an integer, and 0 otherwise.

## LessThan

Parameters: none
Input signal(s): in[2]. Assume that it is known ahead of time that these are at most 
2^252 − 1.
Output signal(s): out
Specification: If in[0] is strictly less than in[1], out should be 1. Otherwise, out should be 0.

Extension 1: If you know that the input signals are at most 2^k - 1 (k ≤ 252), how can you reduce the total number of constraints that this circuit requires? Write a version of this circuit parametrized in k.
Extension 2: Write LessEqThan (tests if in[0] is ≤ in[1]), GreaterThan, and GreaterEqThan

## IntegerDivide

NOTE: This circuit is pretty hard!

Parameters: nbits. Use assert to assert that this is at most 126!
Input signal(s): dividend, divisor
Output signal(s): remainder, quotient
Specification: First, check that the dividend and divisor are at most nbits in bitlength. Next, compute and constrain remainder and quotient.

Extension: How would you modify the circuit to handle negative dividends?
